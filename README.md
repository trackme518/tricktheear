If you are here for Camera logging component for tracking user movement and rotation in VR and sending the data over websocket you can use it like this:

```html
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trackme518/tricktheear/logVR/a-frame/logCamera.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<a-scene>
<a-entity camera look-controls wasd-controls rotation-reader="ip: ws://10.0.0.18:8025/track; position: true, rotation: true; interval: 100;"></a-entity>
<a-scene>
</body>
</html>
```

To recieve the data and log the in text file you need another app. It can also be a-frame web based app or anything else that can handle parsing websockets. The incoming data look like this:

```
-0.31928554801974135;1.6;-0.11819450292053287;0.024000000000000195;0.28200000000000036;0;12681
```

All values are split by delimeter ";". First three values are x,y,z component of position and another three are x,y,z components of rotation. The last parameter is a timestamp in miliseconds since the program started. 

If you are on windows64bit you can simply just downlaod latest build of our reciever and run logVR.exe - no installation is needed:

You can start recording the incoming data by pressing "r" on keyboard. You will end recording by pressing "r" again. Data will be saved in data folder with current date in the file name. We have also added heatmap image as an output - it is generated automatically when recording.
